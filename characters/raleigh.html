    <p>RALEIGH ST. CLAIR 
        <br>
        Margot?
        
        May I come in, please?
        
        How are you, my darling?
        
        Seventeen October. Third examination of
        Dudley Heinsbergen.
        
        All right, Dudley. Make yours look like
        mine.
        
        My goodness. How interesting. How
        bizarre.
        
        Dudley suffers from a rare disorder
        combining the symptoms of amnesia,
        dyslexia and color-blindness, with a
        highly acute sense of hearing.
        
        There is also evidence of --
        
        I’m afraid you are.
        
        
        You have a visitor, my darling.
        
        But why is this bloody necessary?
        
        You don’t love me anymore, do you?
        
        
        
        How long do you intend to stay here?
        
        Are you ever coming home?
        
        You’re joking.
        
        I want to die.
        
        Have you met someone else?
        
        Richard, I know you’re terribly close to
        Margot, and perhaps you understand her
        better than anyone else.
        
        Nevertheless, may I confide in you?
        
        I believe she’s having an affair.
        
        I’m utterly devastated. I don’t know
        where else to turn. Will you advise me?
        
        Well, I thought, perhaps --
        
        (pause)
        Well, no. I thought we might --
        Richie punches his hand through the attic window
        
        (hesitates)
        I don’t know, at the moment.
        
        
        
        Very little, I assure you.
        
        We would, rather. Yes.
        
        She smokes.
        
        No.
        
        You’ve made a cuckold of me.
        
        Many times over.
        
        And you’ve nearly killed your poor
        brother.
        
        She’s balling Eli Cash.
        
        May I have a cigarette?
        
        Shall I repeat the question?
        
        (bitterly)
        I bloody well know that.
        
        And a light, please?
        
        Thank you.
        
        
        
        That’s not terribly serious, is it?
        (to the priest)
        Do you have an alternative?
        
        What’s so funny, Dudley?
        
        Oh, my Lord, no.
