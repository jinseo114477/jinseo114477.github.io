Margot?

May I come in, please?

How are you, my darling?

Seventeen October. Third examination of
Dudley Heinsbergen.

All right, Dudley. Make yours look like
mine.

My goodness. How interesting. How
bizarre.

Dudley suffers from a rare disorder
combining the symptoms of amnesia,
dyslexia and color-blindness, with a
highly acute sense of hearing.

There is also evidence of --

I’m afraid you are.

You have a visitor, my darling.

But why is this bloody necessary?

You don’t love me anymore, do you?


<img class=image src="/raleigh.png">


How long do you intend to stay here?

Are you ever coming home?

You’re joking.

I want to die.

Richard, I know you’re terribly close to
Margot, and perhaps you understand her

Nevertheless, may I confide in you?

I believe she’s having an affair.

She smokes.

No.

You’ve made a cuckold of me.

Many times over.

And you’ve nearly killed your poor
brother.

She’s balling Eli Cash.

May I have a cigarette?

Shall I repeat the question?

(bitterly)
I bloody well know that.

And a light, please?

Thank you.

That’s not terribly serious, is it?
(to the priest)
Do you have an alternative?

What’s so funny, Dudley?

Oh, my Lord, no.
