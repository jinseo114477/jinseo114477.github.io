        I’ll hold, thank you.
        
        (pause)
        Write yourself a check.
        
        Bene. Si. Grazie mille.
        
        
        
        
        What do you mean?
        
        (pause)
        But I thought it was --
        
        Yes?
        
        No, I didn’t.
        
        This isn’t really a tax issue, is it?
        
        Let me think about it, Henry.
        
        
        
        Chas?
        
        What’s going on?
        
        Did you call a locksmith?
        
        (pause)
        I don’t understand. Did you pack your
        bags before you got locked out? Or how
        did you --
        
        Excuse me for a moment, please.
        
        But there’s no sprinklers here, either.
        
        It’s me, sweetie.
        
        Raleigh says you’ve been spending six
        hours a day locked in here watching
        television and soaking in the tub.
        
        Well, I don’t think that’s very healthy,
        do you? Nor do I think it’s very
        intelligent to keep an electrical gadget
        on the edge of the bathtub.
        
        Well, it can’t be very good for your
        eyes, anyway.
        
        Chas came home.
        
        He and Ari and Uzi are going to stay
        with me for a little while.
        
        (hesitates)
        Well, I don’t know, exactly. But I
        think he’s been very depressed ever
        since --
        
        (pause)
        So are you what?
        
        What are you doing here?
        
        Are you crazy?
        
        Stop following me.
        
        Well, you can’t have it. I’m sorry for
        you, but it’s too late.
        
        What are you talking about?
        
        What happened?
        
        Oh, my God.
        
        I’m sorry. I didn’t know.
        
        What’d they say? What’s the prognosis?
        
        What are you talking about?
        
        (urgently)
        Where’s the doctor? Let’s get --
        
        What’s wrong with you?
        
        Go away!
        
        Are you or aren’t you?
        
        More or less.
        
        Hard to say.
        
        
        
        Royal, this is Henry Sherman.
        
        Don’t pay any attention to that man,
        Henry.
        
        Good. Now I’ll just remove the loose
        soil and note the decomposition levels.
        
        These were probably slaves. Before the
        arrival of the --
        
        Don’t be silly.
        
        Why? I thought it was very sweet.
        
        That’s ridiculous.
        
        Henry, I have no interest in Frank
        Benedict or Doug Cartwright. I never
        did.
        
        And as far as Royal is concerned, he’s
        the most --
        
        Are you all right?
        
        Wait a second, Henry.
        
        I’m sorry. I’m very nervous.
        
        To tell you the truth, I haven’t slept
        with a man in eighteen years.
        
        I think I’m falling for Henry.
        
        What do you think of him?
        
        I’ll tell you a secret. He asked me to
        marry him.
        
        (hesitates)
        Well, I haven’t accepted yet. Besides,
        you already have a father, sweetheart.
        
        
        
        Have you spoken to him about this?
        
        Call him Henry.
        
        You’ve known him for ten years.
        
        Nor is it yours.
        
        Oh, my goodness!
        
        OK.
        
        Not really.
        
        Thanks.
        
        (nods)
        He always sends me his clippings.
        
        I think he just likes the encouragement.
        He’s done it for years. He used to send
        me his grades in college.
        
        He has his reasons.
        
        I think that’s terrible advice.
        
        How are you feeling?
        
        (pause)
        OK.
        
        I tried to. Lately, I feel like maybe I
        didn’t do such a great job.
        
        Well, then why didn’t you give a damn
        about us, Royal? Why didn’t you care?
        
        Nothing.
        
        Nothing. Just these little expressions
        of yours.
        
        None of your business.
        
        
        
        (hesitates)
        I don’t think the timing’s right for
        that, Henry.
        
        Well, I hope you’re right.
        (pause)
        Actually, I don’t believe I’m going to
        join you tonight. I’ll call you in the
        morning.
        
        What’s going on here?
        
        (on the intercom)
        OK.
        
        But why would he --
        
        Were you part of this?
        
        Why’d you do this to us, Royal?
        
        What was the point?
        
        But we hadn’t spoken in seven years.
        
        (pause)
        You’re a bastard.
        
        Goodbye, Royal.
        
        
        
        
        Yes, please.
        
        Maybe we’re rushing things, Henry.
        
        OK.
        
        Actually, I should go.
        
        No, I think you’re right. I should go.
        
        Are you in any pain?
        
        Don’t press him right now.
        
        All right. That’s enough. The doctor
        said to let him sleep.
        
        What’s he talking about?
        
        Oh, my goodness.
        
        How long have you been a smoker?
        
        Well, I think you should quit.
        
        Richie Tenenbaum, please.
        
        Royal Tenenbaum.
        
        (hesitates)
        Why? What does it say there? They
        don’t want me?
        
        I think if we shimmy up that gutter and
        jump across the window ledge we can pry
        open the ventilation shaft and –
        
        
        
        What’s this?
        
        From you?
        
        Are we divorced?
        
        
        
        What are you chewing on?
        
        Is it working?
        
        What was that?
        
        Oh, my God.
        
        You boys come over here with me.
        
        I know, but there’s nothing we can do
        for him, at the moment.
