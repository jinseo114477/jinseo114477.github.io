            When are we going home?

            You told us he was already dead. 
            
              
            Buckley.
            
            (pause)
            Thank you.
            
            Ari.
            
            Fine.
            
            Sixteen times a week.
            
            I bet Mom would’ve wanted us to meet him
            before he died, wouldn’t she?
            
            Uzi. Shh.
            
            Did you try to sew it back on?
            
            Yes, sir.
            
            Ok.
            
            Ok.
            
            
            
            (to Richie)
            Where are you going to sleep?
            
            We don’t mind, Dad. We like him.
            
            We take boxing and self-defense class.
            
            What do you mean?
            
            Who stabbed you?
            
            
            
            Dad, they ran over Buckley.
            
            But Buckley’s still under there.
            
            Dear Heavenly Father --
            </p>
