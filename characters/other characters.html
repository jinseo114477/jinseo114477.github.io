        Done.
        
        I’m not color-blind, am I?
        
        
        
        That taxi has a dent in it.
        Another dent here and another dent
        there.
        
        
        
        
        You want to play some word games or do
        some experiments on me or anything?
        
        Who?

        
        
        You look great!
        REPORTER
        Thank you. I have a two-part question.
        <br>
        MANAGER
        I’ve been instructed to refuse any
        further charges on your room account and
        to direct you in writing to please
        vacate the premises by the end of the
        month.
    
    Can you pay her in cash?

    RADIO OPERATOR
    Dear Eli, I’m in the middle of the
    ocean. I haven’t left my room in four
    days. I’ve never been more lonely in my
    life, and I think I’m in love with
    Margot.
    <br>
    BELLBOY
    There’s a call for you, Mr. Tenenbaum.
    
    A Mr. Pagoda.
    
    
    
    <br>
    DOCTOR
    Well, there’s a number of possibilities.
    Severe nausea and dizziness are
    standard. A certain percentage of
    patients may also experience seizure.
    
    In some cases.
    
    <br>
    WAITER
    Yes, sir. Go ahead.
    
    
    <br>
    SABRINA
    What?
    
    Hello, darling.
    <br>
    FATHER (Margot’s biological dad)
    Now just set one of them hickory trunks
    right up on top there, sister Maggie.
    <br>
    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
    That’s seventy-two unforced errors for
    Richie Tenenbaum. He’s playing the
    worst tennis of his life. What’s he
    feeling right now, Tex Hayward?
    
    Who’s he looking at in the friends’ box,
    Tex?
    <br>
    TEX HAYWARD (V.O.)
    I don’t know, Jim. There’s obviously
    something wrong with him. He’s taken
    off his shoes and one of his socks, and -
    - actually, I think he’s crying.
    
    That’s his sister, Margot, and her new
    husband, Raleigh St. Clair. They were
    just married yesterday, Jim.
    <br>
    JUDGE
    And how was it possible for Mr.
    Tenenbaum to withdraw these funds
    without your written authorization?
    <br>
    ROYAL’S LAWYER
    This isn’t a courtroom, Royal. Don’t
    object.
    <br>
    MAINTENANCE MAN
    Hey, Baumer! All right!
    
    
    
    <br>
    MANAGER
    They’ve been placed in storage.
    
    I’m sorry. Would you like to --
    
    I’d be happy to make a reservation for
    you at another hotel.
    
    Frederick?
    
    
    <br>
    PETER (interviewer of Eli)
    Right. They’ve come on hard times now,
    haven’t they?
    
    Now, your previous novel --
    
    Right. Not a success. Why?
    
    (looking around)
    What?
    
    Are you all right?
    
    
    <br>
    DETECTIVE
    How much do you already know, gentlemen?
    
    Would you like to examine the report?
    
    Yes.
    <br>
    MANAGER
    All right. Everything seems to be in
    order. I’ll contact you in the next
    twenty-four hours.
    
    I’ll inform you of my decision at the
    appropriate time.
    <br>
    DOCTOR
    He’ll probably sleep for several hours,
    and then I’ll come back to check on him.
    <br>
    NURSE
    Your name?
    
    I’m afraid visiting hours are over, sir.
    
    I’m sorry. I have to refer you to Dr.
    Burroughs. He’ll be in tomorrow
    afternoon.
    
    
    <br>

    Hello, sir.
    
    You’re welcome.
    
    
    <br>
    WALTER
    Nice to meet you.
    
    Go around to the other side!
    
    But these aren’t structure-bearing
    elements, Dad.
    
    <br>
    PRIEST
    (nods)
    So they were raised in the church.

    You’re Eli Cash.
    
    I love your work.

    PARAMEDIC
    I think he may’ve broken his ankle.

    This is my adopted daughter, Elaine
