Royal Tenenbaum bought the house on
Archer Avenue in the winter of his
thirty-fifth year.

Over the next decade, he and his wife
had three children and then they
separated.

They were never legally divorced.

Etheline Tenenbaum kept the house and
raised the children, and their education
was her highest priority.

She wrote a book on the subject.

Chas Tenenbaum had, since elementary
school, taken most of his meals in his
room, standing up at his desk with a cup
of coffee, to save time.

In the sixth grade, he went into
business, breeding dalmation mice, which
he sold to a pet shop in Little Tokyo.

He started buying real estate in his
early teens and seemed to have an almost
preternatural understanding of
international finance.

He negotiated the purchase of his
father’s summer house on Eagle’s Island.

The BB was still lodged between two
knuckles in Chas’ left hand.

Margot Tenenbaum was adopted at the age
of two. Her father had always noted
this when introducing her.

She was a playwright and won a Braverman
Grant of fifty-thousand dollars in the
ninth grade.

She and her brother Richie ran away from
home one winter and camped out in the
African Wing of the Public Archives.

Four years later, she disappeared alone
for almost two weeks and came back with
half a finger missing.

Richie Tenenbaum had been a champion
tennis player since the third grade.

He turned pro at seventeen and won the
U.S. Nationals three years in a row.

He kept a studio in the corner of the
ballroom but had failed to develop as a
painter.

On weekends, Royal took him on outings
around the city.

These invitations were never extended to
anyone else.

Richie’s best friend Eli Cash lived with
his aunt in a building across the
street.

He was a regular fixture at family
gatherings, holidays, mornings before
school and most afternoons.

The three Tenenbaum children performed
Margot’s first play on the night of her
eleventh birthday.

They had agreed to invite their father
to the party.

He had not been invited to any of their
parties since.

In fact, virtually all memory of the
brilliance of the young Tenenbaums had
been erased by two decades of betrayal,
failure and disaster.

Royal had lived in the Lindbergh Palace
Hotel for twenty-two years.

He was a prominent litigator until the
mid-eighties, when he was disbarred and
briefly imprisoned.

No one in his family had spoken to him
in three years.

Richie had retired from professional
tennis at twenty-six. His last match
had been widely discussed in the media.

For the past year he had been traveling
alone on an ocean liner called the Cote
d’Ivoire and had seen both poles, five
oceans, the Amazon and the Nile.
Eli was an assistant professor of
English Literature at Brooks College.
The recent publication of his second
novel –

-- had earned him a sudden, unexpected
literary celebrity.

Margot was married to the writer and
neurologist Raleigh St. Clair.

She was known for her extreme secrecy.
For example, none of the Tenenbaums knew
she was a smoker, which she had been
since the age of twelve.

Nor were they aware of her first
marriage and divorce to a recording
artist in Jamaica.

She kept a private studio in Mockingbird
Heights under the name Helen Scott.

She had not completed a play in seven
years.

Raleigh’s next book was on the subject
of a condition he called Heinsbergen’s
Syndrome.

Chas’ wife, Rachael, was killed in a
plane crash the previous summer.

Chas and their two sons, Ari and Uzi,
were also on the flight and survived, as
did their dog, who was discovered in his
cage several thousand yards from the
crash site.

Over the last six months, he had become
increasingly concerned with their
safety.

Etheline became an archaeologist and had
overseen excavations for the Department
of Housing and the Transit Authority.

She taught bridge class twice a week
with her friend and business manager,
Henry Sherman.

Since her separation from her husband,
she had had many suitors –

-- but had not considered a single one
until this moment.

That night, Etheline found all of her
children living together under the same
roof for the first time in seventeen
years.

The next morning Richie woke at dawn.
He had decided birds should not be kept
in cages, fed Mordecai three sardines,
and set him free.

Immediately after making this statement,
Royal realized that it was true.

Royal dug a hole for Buckley behind the
garden shed, and buried him in a canvas
duffle bag.

Etheline and Henry were married fortyeight
hours later, in judge’s chambers.

Margot’s new play, The Levinsons in the
Trees, was produced at the Cavendish
Theatre.

It ran for just under two weeks and
received mixed reviews.

Raleigh and Dudley went on a lecture
tour to eleven universities in the
promotion of their new book.

Eli checked himself into a
rehabilitation hospital in North Dakota.

Richie started a programme teaching
competitive tennis to eight- to twelveyear-
olds at the 375th Street Y.

Royal had a heart attack at the age of
sixty-eight.

Chas rode with him in the ambulance, and
was the only witness to his father’s
death.

In his will, he stipulated that his
funeral take place at dusk.
