    <p>CHAS TENENBAUM 
        <br>
        (pointedly)
        Do you still love Mom?
        
        Well, she says –
        
        I need $187.
        
        The gentleman in the blue cardigan,
        please.
        
        Go ahead.
        
        What are you doing? You’re on my team!
        
        What’d you think, Dad?
        
        Did you think the characters were –
        
        
        
        Fire alarm! Ari! Uzi! Let’s go! Look
        alive!
        
        Uzi! Let’s go!
        
        No elevators! There’s a fire!
        
        You forgot him.
        
        Four minutes and forty-eight seconds.
        We’re all dead. Burned to a crisp.
        
        It doesn’t matter.
        
        
        
        Give us a hand, Pagoda.
        
        We got locked out of our apartment.
        
        (hesitates)
        Uh-huh.
        
        It’s not safe over there.
        
        The apartment. I have to get some new
        sprinklers and a back-up security system
        installed.
        
        Well, we might have to do something
        about that, too.
        
        Isn’t this great? It feels like we’re
        camping.
        
        Who put that in here?
        
        See you in the morning.
        
        You know what? I’m going to sleep in
        here, and that way we can all be
        together.
        
        His name’s Royal Tenenbaum.
        
        (hesitates)
        But now he’s really dying.
        
        
        
        (yawning)
        How long are you going to last?
        
        A month? A year?
        
        No.
        
        I speak for myself.
        
        My wife.
        
        Chas?
        
        Why?
        
        I think we’ll pass.
        
        I wouldn’t know. Excuse me.
        
        Why’d you shoot me?
        
        No. We were on the same team.
        
        Because I started the corporation when I
        was a minor, so my father was the
        primary signatory on most of my
        accounts.
        
        He also stole bonds out of my safety
        deposit box when I was fourteen.
        
        Why should I?
        
        
        
        I’m sorry. Maybe I’m a little confused.
        What are you suggesting?
        
        That he come here and stay in my room.
        
        Who gives a shit?
        
        You poor sucker. You poor, washed-up
        poppa’s boy.
        
        Don’t get in the middle of this, Mr.
        Sherman. This is a family matter.
        
        I prefer Mr. Sherman.
        
        Why? I don’t know him that well.
        
        As your accountant, Mr. Sherman, yes.
        
        Uzi.
        
        It’s not your decision, goddammit.
        
        Get out.
        
        Are you OK?
        
        Can we move him?
        
        For how long?
        
        Lights out, old man.
        
        Sorry. 11:30. Lights out.
        
        Have to finish it up in the morning.
        Them’s the rules.
        
        Looks like you and Dad are back together
        again, huh?
        
        No, he’s not.
        (pause)
        You really hate me, don’t you?
        
        Well, I don’t know what you think you’re
        going to get out of this. But believe
        me, whatever it is, it’s not worth it.
        
        (gritting his teeth)
        Stop saying that.
        
        What do you need?
        
        Please, don’t come in this room.
        
        Where’ve you been?
        
        (concerned)
        What’s that?
        
        Stay away from my children. Do you
        understand?
        
        (screams)
        Are you listening to me?
        
        
        
        Yes. Can you send a taxi to 111 Archer
        Avenue? Right away, please. Thank you.
        
        
        
        Why’d you try to kill yourself?
        
        Can we read it?
        
        Could you paraphrase it for us?
        
        Is it dark?
        
        
        
        Henry’s your dad?
        
        So you’ve been married before?
        
        Oh, yeah. I forgot.
        (pause)
        You know, I’m a widower myself.
        
        Where are you?
        
        What?
        
        He did?
        
        Eli!
        
        Yeah.
        
        Yeah.
        
        So do I.
        
        What’s this?
        
        You did?
        
        What’s his name?
        
        Thank you.
        
        We’ve had a rough year, Dad.
