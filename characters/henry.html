    <p>HENRY SHERMAN 
        <br>
        Apropos of my question re: I-40 slash I-
        9 adjustments.
        
        It would probably be advantageous for
        your marital status to be legally
        established as single, in light of the
        circumstances.
        
        I mean for tax purposes.
        
        Etheline?
        
        Will you marry me?
        Pagoda stops peeling the potatoes
        
        I love you. Did you already know that?
        
        (pause)
        That’s true. I don’t know why I put it
        that way.
        
        
        
        Have you told your children?
        
        And are they all right?
        
        
        
        How do you do?
        
        I’m sorry to interrupt your work.
        
        I just wanted to apologize for the other
        day. When I proposed to you.
        
        Look. I know I’m not as accomplished as
        some of the men you’ve been involved
        with. Franklin Benedict and General
        Cartwright and your ex-husband and --
        
        But I feel I have just as much to offer
        as any of them. I know I went about it
        backwards, but --
        
        I’m fine. Anyway, let me know when you
        make up your mind.
        
        That’s OK. Thank you. Why are you –
        
        
        
        All right. Let’s not get out of hand.
        
        Please, call me Henry.
        
        
        
        I’d like you to talk to Royal about us,
        if you don’t mind.
        
        Well, I’d agree if I thought he was
        really going to die in six weeks. But I
        don’t.
        
        (pause)
        OK.
        
        (pause)
        I beg your pardon?
        
        (long pause)
        Coltrane?
        
        Did you just call me Coltrane?
        
        You didn’t?
        
        (pause)
        OK.
        
        You don’t think so?
        
        (seething)
        Listen, Royal. If you think --
        
        (yelling)
        Oh, yeah?
        
        Sit down!
        
        I said, sit down, goddammit!
        
        This is not your house.
        
        Hello. I’m calling in regards to a Dr.
        McClure. Yes. At Colby General. The
        name of the patient is Royal Tenenbaum.
        
        How much is he paying you?
        
        Etheline? Would you mind coming up here
        for a minute, please?
        
        You’ll see.
        
        Hold on a minute, please.
        
        Pagoda has something to say.
        
        (angrily)
        No, he doesn’t.
        I know what stomach cancer looks like.
        I’ve seen it.
        
        And you don’t eat three cheeseburgers a
        day with french fries when you’ve got
        it. The pain is excruciating.
        
        My wife had it.
        
        Not only is there no Dr. McClure at
        Colby General, there’s no Colby General.
        It closed in 1974.
        
        Of course he was.
        
        
        
        
        Would you like another glass of wine?
        
        You’re right. It’s awkward sitting here
        in our pajamas and everything. We don’t
        have to do this right now. Let’s just
        try and have a nice time.
        
        Yes, I think we’re both a little uneasy,
        and there’s no need for us to force
        anything. There’s no hurry. Let’s just
        -
        
        Can I, at least, offer you some dessert?
        
        How can I help?
        
        
        
        (hesitates)
        Hello.
        
        
        
        It’s slightly uneven.
        
        Hello, Richie. This is my son, Walter
        Sherman.
        
        Yes. I’m a widower.
        
        I know you are, Chas.
        
        I don’t think you’re an asshole, Royal.
        You’re just a kind of a son of a bitch.
        
        It doesn’t matter. It’s still best to
        file under force majeure and recoup the
        deductible.
        
        So help me God.
