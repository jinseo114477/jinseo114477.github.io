    <p>ELI CASH 
        <br>
        You said I could run away, too
        
        
        
        The crickets and the rust-beetles
        scuttled among the nettles of the
        sagethicket. Vamanos, amigos, he
        whispered, and threw the busted leather
        flintscraw over the loose weave of the
        saddlecock. And they rode on in the
        friscalating dusklight.
        
        Well, everyone knows Custer died at
        Little Bighorn. What this book
        presupposes is:
        (tentatively)
        maybe he didn’t?
        
        Let me ask you something. Why would a
        reviewer make the point of saying
        someone’s not a genius? I mean, do you
        think I’m especially not a genius?
        Isn’t that --
        
        You didn’t even have to think about it,
        did you?
        
        
        
        Hello, beautiful.
        
        Could we have dinner with your mother
        sometime?
        
        (shrugs)
        I don’t know. I’d just love to see her.
        
        I’m very sorry, Margot.
        
        That’s true.
        
        
        
        Right there is where I used to go get
        jacked off.
        
        You don’t give a shit.
        
        That’s right.
        
        How’s Richie?
        
        Yeah. Me, either. He wrote me a
        letter. He says he’s in love with you.
        
        (shrugs)
        That’s what he said. I don’t know how
        we’re supposed to take it. Hang on.
        
        Sugar, it’s Eli.
        
        I just got to pick something up. Don’t
        repeat that, by the way. About Richie.
        It was told in confidence.
        
        Oh, my Lord. Look at you.
        
        (hesitates)
        Why? Did she mention it?
        
        Yes, I did.
        
        I know. I’m sorry. Why would she have
        repeated that, I wonder?
        
        (pause)
        Rightly so.
        
        Sabrina?
        
        Look what I found on the doorstep.
        
        Charlotte? Stetson? Say hello to Uncle
        Richie.
        
        (sadly)
        I fell down the stairs with her.
        
        That’s Cinnamon. Hello, Cinnamon.
        
        What’d you say?
        
        What?
        
        When? Right now?
        (pause)
        I’m sorry. Don’t listen to me.
        (barely audible)
        I’m on mescaline. I’ve been spaced out
        all day.
        
        (nods)
        I did, indeed. Very much so.
        
        I’m worried about you, Richie.
        
        Well, actually, Margot is, for some
        reason. But I did find it odd when you
        said you were in love with her.
        (pause)
        She’s married, you know.
        
        And she’s your sister.
        
        
        
        Well, I grew up with the Tenenbaum
        family, you know.
        
        Wildcattin’.
        
        Hm. Well, Wildcattin’ was written in a
        kind of obsolete vernacular, much like
        the --
        
        Holy shit.
        
        (concerned)
        Why is it so dense in here?
        
        
        
        I’m not in love with you any more.
        
        Let’s not make this any more difficult
        than it already is.
        
        OK, what?
        
        I know. You’re in love with Richie.
        Which is sick and gross.
        
        Please, stop ridiculing me.
        
        You never gave me the time of day until
        I started getting good reviews.
        
        But the sales are.
        
        
        
        Yes?
        
        Hey, Richie.
        
        (pause)
        Is it just you guys?
        
        I guess Margot and your mother couldn’t
        make it.
        
        What happened there?
        
        (pause)
        They went back to England.
        
        What do you mean?
        
        Of course. I can’t believe you would
        ask me that.
        
        I’m sorry. I don’t know what to say.
        
        I always wanted to be a Tenenbaum, you
        know?
        
        But it doesn’t mean what it used to,
        does it?
        
        I wish you’d’ve done this for me when I
        was a kid.
        
        Yeah, but it still would’ve meant a lot
        to me. Anyway, I really appreciate your
        coming over here now. I do recognize
        that I have a problem, and I want to get
        better. Let me just get my things.
        
        
        
        Here I come.
        
        Where are my shoes?
        
        Did I hit anybody?
        
        Is everybody okay?
        
        Help! Please!
        
        Did I hit the dog?
        
        (pause)
        Is he dead?
        
        (pause)
        I need help.
        
        At which point I apparently lost control
        of the vehicle, smashed it into the
        house, and killed that poor dog.
        
        (pause)
        I am, indeed.
        
        (touched)
        How sweet of you to say so.
