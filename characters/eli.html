The crickets and the rust-beetles
scuttled among the nettles of the
sagethicket. Vamanos, amigos, he
whispered, and threw the busted leather
flintscraw over the loose weave of the
saddlecock. And they rode on in the
friscalating dusklight.

Well, everyone knows Custer died at
Little Bighorn. What this book
presupposes is:
(tentatively)
maybe he didn’t?

Let me ask you something. Why would a
reviewer make the point of saying
someone’s not a genius? I mean, do you
think I’m especially not a genius?
Isn’t that --

You didn’t even have to think about it,
did you?


<img class=image src="/eli.png">


Hello, beautiful.

Could we have dinner with your mother
sometime?

(shrugs)
I don’t know. I’d just love to see her.

I’m very sorry, Margot.

That’s true.


<img class=image src="/eli.png">


Right there is where I used to go get
jacked off.

You don’t give a shit.

That’s right.

How’s Richie?

Yeah. Me, either. He wrote me a
letter. He says he’s in love with you.

(shrugs)
That’s what he said. I don’t know how
we’re supposed to take it. Hang on.

Sugar, it’s Eli.

I just got to pick something up. Don’t
repeat that, by the way. About Richie.
It was told in confidence.

Oh, my Lord. Look at you.

(hesitates)
Why? Did she mention it?

Yes, I did.

I know. I’m sorry. Why would she have
repeated that, I wonder?

(pause)
Rightly so.

Sabrina?

Look what I found on the doorstep.

Charlotte? Stetson? Say hello to Uncle
Richie.

(sadly)
I fell down the stairs with her.

That’s Cinnamon. Hello, Cinnamon.

What’d you say?

What?

When? Right now?
(pause)
I’m sorry. Don’t listen to me.
(barely audible)
I’m on mescaline. I’ve been spaced out
all day.

(nods)
I did, indeed. Very much so.

I’m worried about you, Richie.

Well, actually, Margot is, for some
reason. But I did find it odd when you
said you were in love with her.
(pause)
She’s married, you know.

And she’s your sister.

Well, I grew up with the Tenenbaum
family, you know.

Wildcattin’.

Hm. Well, Wildcattin’ was written in a
kind of obsolete vernacular, much like
the --

Holy shit.

(concerned)
Why is it so dense in here?


<img class=image src="/eli.png">


I’m not in love with you any more.

Let’s not make this any more difficult
than it already is.

OK, what?

I know. You’re in love with Richie.
Which is sick and gross.

Please, stop ridiculing me.

You never gave me the time of day until
I started getting good reviews.

But the sales are.


<img class=image src="/eli.png">


Yes?

Hey, Richie.

(pause)
Is it just you guys?

I guess Margot and your mother couldn’t
make it.

What happened there?

(pause)
They went back to England.

What do you mean?

Of course. I can’t believe you would
ask me that.

I’m sorry. I don’t know what to say.

I always wanted to be a Tenenbaum, you
know?

But it doesn’t mean what it used to,
does it?

I wish you’d’ve done this for me when I
was a kid.

Yeah, but it still would’ve meant a lot
to me. Anyway, I really appreciate your
coming over here now. I do recognize
that I have a problem, and I want to get
better. Let me just get my things.


<img class=image src="/eli.png">


Here I come.

Where are my shoes?

Did I hit anybody?

Is everybody okay?

Help! Please!

Did I hit the dog?

(pause)
Is he dead?

(pause)
I need help.

At which point I apparently lost control
of the vehicle, smashed it into the
house, and killed that poor dog.

(pause)
I am, indeed.

(touched)
How sweet of you to say so.
