        You’re welcome.
        
        
        
        Hello, sir.
        
        Of course.
        
        His condition is stable. The attack was
        just a side-effect. I recommend that
        you push fluids and continue the stomach
        cancer medication.
        
        Absolutely not.
        
        We’ll have to wait and see.
        
        That depends. Is he a fighter?
        
        (solemnly)
        Then that’s the best we’ve got. Now, if
        you’ll excuse me, I have another call to
        make.
        
        
        
        I already did.
        
        
        
        Can you see out of it?
        
        Uh-huh. Minor corneal damage. Page me
        if it spreads to the other eye.
        </p>
