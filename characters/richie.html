Do you still love us?

Why’d she ask you to leave?

Hi, Eli.

He has permission to sleep over.

Go, Mordecai.


<img class=image src="/richie.png">


Read it back to me so far, Pietro.

New paragraph.

Your friend, Richie. End of letter.


<img class=image src="/richie.png">


I’d like to send a response, Alberto.

Dear Mom, I received your message. I’m
coming home as soon as possible.
(pause)
Who do I see about that?


<img class=image src="/richie.png">


You don’t look so sick, Dad.

What’ve you got?

(pause)
I haven’t been out there since I was
six.

You know, Rachael’s buried there, too.

(pause)
Who?

Yeah.

I believe so.

What?

(shrugs)
Probably.

(pause)
I don’t know, Dad.

(shrugs)
Yeah, but I understood. I know you’re
not very good with disappointment.

How are you and Raleigh getting along?
You think you’re going to get back
together?

Well, if you need someone to talk to,
let me know, OK? I like Raleigh very
much. I know he’s a lot older than you
are, and you’re having some problems,
but -- Anyway, maybe I can help.

You dropped some cigarettes.

Well, they just fell out of your pocket

Did you tell Margot about that letter I
wrote you?

Eli, that was meant to be just between
you and me.

Well, I would ask you the same question.

How’d she break her arm?

(pause)
Hm?

I didn’t say anything.

Did you say you’re on mescaline?

How often do you --

(pause)
Why?

Yeah.

(quickly)
Adopted.


<img class=image src="/richie.png">


I think he’s very lonely. Lonelier than
he lets on, and maybe lonelier than he
even realizes.

Briefly. And he agreed that --

That he come here and stay in my room.

(sincerely)
No, I’m not. Anyway, I think he’d be
much more comfortable here than --

I do.

I’ll just camp out upstairs.

Oh, that’s OK. I’ve got an old Scout
cot and a couple of army blankets.

Well, he’s already up there.

I think he’s asleep, because of the
medication he’s on. But I guess you can
wake him up and throw him out, if Mom
says it’s OK.

Dad?

Mom!

Is he going to be all right?

Yeah.

(pause)
He’s your dad, too, Chas.

(puzzled)
No, I don’t. I love you.

I don’t want to hurt you, Chas. I know
what you and the boys have been through.
You’re my brother, and I love you.

I doubt it.

(pause)
OK.

I don’t know. What do you want to do?

Find the guy and get him?

Who do you think it might be?


<img class=image src="/richie.png">


Nothing.

(pause)
He’s on drugs.

How’d you get all these medical
supplies?

Dad. You were never dying.


<img class=image src="/richie.png">


I’m going to kill myself tomorrow.

Fine, thanks.

Not really.

I wrote a suicide note.

Yeah. Right after I regained
consciousness.

No.

I don’t think so.

Of course it’s dark. It’s a suicide
note.

What are you doing in my tent?

I checked myself out.

(pause)
Probably.

I don’t know. You want to see?

I heard about your ex-husband.

(hesitates)
I guess so. I didn’t get his name.

(nods)
And I heard about Eli.

(surprised)
You did?

I have to tell you something.

I love you.

I can’t stop thinking about you. I went
away for a year, and it only got worse.
I don’t know what to do.

Yeah, but it’s not your fault.

(pause)
I doubt it.


<img class=image src="/richie.png">


It doesn’t matter.

So you’re elevator operators now.

What made you decide to do that?

You asked me why I choked out there that
day.

Well, I think I know the answer, and I
wanted your advice.

Yeah.

Since always,

Un-huh.

I think she feels confused.

I don’t think so. We’re not related by
blood.

(pause)
That’s OK.

Sure, I do.

I know you do, Pop.

Mordecai?
You came back.

I’m not so sure this is Mordecai.

Yeah, but now he has white feathers on
his neck.

I need your help with something else.

Well, I think --

(hesitates)
I didn’t mean right this second.

We want to take you to get some help.

(hesitates)
Nothing.

Where’s Sabrina?

Are we still friends?

Are we?

It doesn’t matter. I heard about you
and Margot.

You don’t have to say anything.

(pause)
But you didn’t have a drug problem then.


<img class=image src="/richie.png">


Henry?

Nice to meet you, Walter.

He saved them. Kind of.

Chas! Don’t!

Chas?

Not really.

I don’t know.
(pause)
Sometimes when people have a traumatic
experience, their hair turns white.
How old you think those are?

Rod Laver used it. You know who Laver
is?
