            <span class="hover-info">Royal is the much-maligned and difficult patriarch of the Tenenbaum family. He lives indulgently and selfishly, remaining absent from his children's lives for a long time, but coming back to get to know them when he finds himself out of money and with nowhere to go. Because he is so distrusted by his family, he devises a story about his imminent death in order to coerce his family into taking him back in and taking care of him. Even then, however, they don't really want to take care of him, since he's been such a louse his whole life. By the end, he has owned up to his own limitations as a father and repaired some of his relationships. He dies of a heart attack, after years of living rather recklessly, drinking, smoking, and eating hamburgers to excess.</span>
