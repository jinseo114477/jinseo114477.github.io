Apropos of my question re: I-40 slash 
I-9 adjustments.

It would probably be advantageous for
your marital status to be legally
established as single, in light of the
circumstances.

I mean for tax purposes.

Etheline?

Will you marry me?
Pagoda stops peeling the potatoes

I love you. Did you already know that?

(pause)
That’s true. I don’t know why I put it
that way.

Have you told your children?

And are they all right?


<img class=image src="/project-1/image/henry.png">


How do you do?

I’m sorry to interrupt your work.

I just wanted to apologize for the other
day. When I proposed to you.

Look. I know I’m not as accomplished as
some of the men you’ve been involved
with. Franklin Benedict and General
Cartwright and your ex-husband and --

But I feel I have just as much to offer
as any of them. I know I went about it
backwards, but --

I’m fine. Anyway, let me know when you
make up your mind.

That’s OK. Thank you. Why are you –


<img class=image src="/project-1/image/henry.png">


All right. Let’s not get out of hand.

Please, call me Henry.


<img class=image src="/project-1/image/henry.png">


I’d like you to talk to Royal about us,
if you don’t mind.

Well, I’d agree if I thought he was
really going to die in six weeks. But I
don’t.

(pause)
OK.

(pause)
I beg your pardon?

(long pause)
Coltrane?

Did you just call me Coltrane?

You didn’t?

(pause)
OK.

You don’t think so?

(seething)
Listen, Royal. If you think --

(yelling)
Oh, yeah?

Sit down!

I said, sit down, goddammit!

This is not your house.

Hello. I’m calling in regards to a Dr.
McClure. Yes. At Colby General. The
name of the patient is Royal Tenenbaum.

How much is he paying you?

Etheline? Would you mind coming up here
for a minute, please?

You’ll see.

Hold on a minute, please.

Pagoda has something to say.

(angrily)
No, he doesn’t.
I know what stomach cancer looks like.
I’ve seen it.

And you don’t eat three cheeseburgers a
day with french fries when you’ve got
it. The pain is excruciating.

My wife had it.

Not only is there no Dr. McClure at
Colby General, there’s no Colby General.
It closed in 1974.

Of course he was.

Would you like another glass of wine?

You’re right. It’s awkward sitting here
in our pajamas and everything. We don’t
have to do this right now. Let’s just
try and have a nice time.

Yes, I think we’re both a little uneasy,
and there’s no need for us to force
anything. There’s no hurry. Let’s just
-

Can I, at least, offer you some dessert?

How can I help?


<img class=image src="/project-1/image/henry.png">


(hesitates)
Hello.


<img class=image src="/project-1/image/henry.png">


It’s slightly uneven.

Hello, Richie. This is my son, Walter
Sherman.

Yes. I’m a widower.

I know you are, Chas.

I don’t think you’re an asshole, Royal.
You’re just a kind of a son of a bitch.

It doesn’t matter. It’s still best to
file under force majeure and recoup the
deductible.

So help me God.
