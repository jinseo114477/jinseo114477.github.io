  <div class= "first-page"> The Royal Tenenbaums was written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson and released in 2001 to great acclaim. <br>
    His third film, The Royal Tenenbaums, follows the development of the three gifted but troubled Tenenbaum children,<br> and their reunion with their absentee father, Royal, on the event of his allegedly imminent death.<br>
    Anderson took inspiration from various sources when developing the script for the film. <br>
    The concept of three preternaturally gifted children growing up in New York was largely inspired by the work of J.D. Salinger, <br>particularly his stories about the Glass children in Franny and Zooey. <br>
    Other inspirations for the film include Murmur of the Heart and The Fire Within, both films by Louis Malle, <br>The Magnificent Ambersons, an Orson Welles film, and the Jean-Pierre Melville film, Les Enfants Terribles. <br>
    The result was a singular film that is unmistakably linked to Wes Anderson's aesthetic and perspective.<br>
