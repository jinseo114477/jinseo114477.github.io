    <p>Etheline and Henry come down the front steps of the Tenenbaum
        house. Henry is dressed in black tie. The ends of a pair of
        theatre tickets stick out of his breast pocket. Pagoda holds
        a gypsy cab for them at the curb.

        NARRATOR 
        Immediately after making this statement,
        Royal realized that it was true.
        <br>
        ROYAL TENENBAUM 
        She said that?
        
        We got the sucker on the ropes.
        
        Can I ask you something?
        
        Are you trying to steal my woman?
        
        You heard me, Coltrane.
        
        What?
        
        No.
        
        No.
        
        But if I did?
        
        You wouldn’t be able to do anything
        about it, would you?
        
        No, I don’t.
        
        You want to talk some jive?
        
        I’ll talk some jive with you.
        
        I’ll talk some jive like you never
        heard!
        
        Right on!
        
        What?
        
        What’d you say?
        
        Oh, I heard you.
        
        I want you out of my house.
        
        Don’t play semantics with me. I want
        your raggedy ass back on the --
        
        Nothing.
        
        Bullshit. Change it.
        
        You think we could get somebody to come
        over here and kill some of these mice
        for us?
        
        Well, tell him to stick them in a
        fucking cage or something.
        
        What’s cooking, Pops?
        
        Son of a bitch. What the hell kind of
        way to act is that?
        
        How would you know?
        
        I guess we’re back on the street, pal.
        
        Time to come clean. No more lies.
        
        A guy at St. Pete’s owed me a favor. I
        did some malpractice work for him. I do
        have high blood pressure, though.
        
        Look. I know I’m the bad guy on this
        one, but I just want to say that the
        last six days have been the best six
        days of, probably, my whole life.
        
        (pause)
        I thought maybe I could win you back.
        Or, anyway, I thought I could get rid of
        Henry and keep things status quo.
        
        I know. Plus, I was broke, and I got
        kicked out of my hotel.
        
        Take it easy on those boys, Chassie. I
        don’t want this to happen to you.
        
        You know, Richie, this illness, this
        closeness to death. It’s been very
        profound for me. I feel like a
        different person. I really do.
        
        (smiles)
        But I’m going to live.
        
        He’s not your father.
        
        How you doing, pal?
        
        Goddammit! That’s the last time I get
        knifed by you! You hear me?
        
        The 375th Street Y, please.
        
        <br>
        ETHELINE TENENBAUM 
        (hesitates)
        I don’t think the timing’s right for
        that, Henry.
        
        Well, I hope you’re right.
        (pause)
        Actually, I don’t believe I’m going to
        join you tonight. I’ll call you in the
        morning.
        
        What’s going on here?
        
        (on the intercom)
        OK.
        
        But why would he --
        
        Were you part of this?
        
        Why’d you do this to us, Royal?
        
        What was the point?
        
        But we hadn’t spoken in seven years.
        
        (pause)
        You’re a bastard.
        
        Goodbye, Royal.
        
        <br>
        HENRY SHERMAN 
        I’d like you to talk to Royal about us,
        if you don’t mind.
        
        Well, I’d agree if I thought he was
        really going to die in six weeks. But I
        don’t.
        
        (pause)
        OK.
        
        (pause)
        I beg your pardon?
        
        (long pause)
        Coltrane?
        
        Did you just call me Coltrane?
        
        You didn’t?
        
        (pause)
        OK.
        
        You don’t think so?
        
        (seething)
        Listen, Royal. If you think --
        
        (yelling)
        Oh, yeah?
        
        Sit down!
        
        I said, sit down, goddammit!
        
        This is not your house.
        
        Hello. I’m calling in regards to a Dr.
        McClure. Yes. At Colby General. The
        name of the patient is Royal Tenenbaum.
        
        How much is he paying you?
        
        Etheline? Would you mind coming up here
        for a minute, please?
        
        You’ll see.
        
        Hold on a minute, please.
        
        Pagoda has something to say.
        
        (angrily)
        No, he doesn’t.
        I know what stomach cancer looks like.
        I’ve seen it.
        
        And you don’t eat three cheeseburgers a
        day with french fries when you’ve got
        it. The pain is excruciating.
        
        My wife had it.
        
        Not only is there no Dr. McClure at
        Colby General, there’s no Colby General.
        It closed in 1974.
        
        Of course he was.
        
        <br>
        CHAS TENENBAUM 
        Yes. Can you send a taxi to 111 Archer
        Avenue? Right away, please. Thank you.
        
        <br>
        MARGOT TENENBAUM 
        What’d you do to your hand?
        
        No. Those belong to Chas. Or, anyway,
        he invented them.
        
        (worried)
        I’ll be right back.
        
        (pause)
        Neither are you.
        
        <br>
        RICHIE TENENBAUM 
        Nothing.
        
        (pause)
        He’s on drugs.
        
        How’d you get all these medical
        supplies?
        
        Dad. You were never dying.
        
        <br>
        ELI CASH 
        Well, I grew up with the Tenenbaum
        family, you know.
        
        Wildcattin’.
        
        Hm. Well, Wildcattin’ was written in a
        kind of obsolete vernacular, much like
        the --
        
        Holy shit.
        
        (concerned)
        Why is it so dense in here?
        
        <br>
        PAGODA 
        He has the cancer.
        
        Ah, shit, man.
        
        You son of a bitch.
        
        <br>
        PETER (interviewer of Eli)
        Right. They’ve come on hard times now,
        haven’t they?
        
        Now, your previous novel --
        
        Right. Not a success. Why?
        
        (looking around)
        What?
        
        Are you all right?
