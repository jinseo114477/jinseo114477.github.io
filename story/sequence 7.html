    <p>The next morning. Richie comes downstairs in his pajamas.
        He carries the stuffed boar’s head. He hangs it on the wall
        in its place.
        
        The elevator at the Lindbergh Palace. Royal is dressed in
        his elevator-operator uniform. He takes three well-dressed
        businessmen down to the lobby. He looks exhausted and
        depressed. The doors open. One of the businessmen hands
        Royal a dollar as they walk out into the lobby.
        <br>
        ROYAL TENENBAUM 
        Thank you, sir.
        
        Going up?
        
        What floor?
        
        Yeah. We just started, but we’ll get a
        bump when we join the union.
        
        Well, we’re broke. But, in answer to
        your question, I guess I’m trying to
        prove I can pay my dues and what-not. I
        just hope somebody knows.
        
        Sure.
        
        Margot Tenenbaum?
        
        Since when?
        
        Does she know?
        
        And what’s her feeling about it?
        
        I can understand that. It’s probably
        illegal.
        
        (pause)
        That’s true.
        
        It’s still frowned upon, but then what
        isn’t these days, right?
        I don’t know. Maybe it works. Why not?
        Hell, you love each other, and nobody
        knows what’s going to happen, so --
        
        You know what? Don’t listen to me. I
        never understood her, myself. I never
        understood any of us. I wish I knew
        what to tell you, but I just don’t.
        
        No, it’s not.
        
        Do you still consider me your father?
        
        I wish I had a little more to offer in
        that department.
        
        I don’t blame you, by the way.
        
        She’s a great looking girl, and she’s
        smart as a whip, and --
        
        Holy shit.
        
        Jiminy Cricket. He must have a goddamn
        radar in his brain.
        
        What do you mean? He flew right in
        here.
        
        Well, the son of a bitch must be
        molting.
        
        (excitedly)
        You got it. What’s the situation?
        
        Hang on.
        
        Pagoda! Let’s hit it!
        
        Would you excuse us, please?
        
        Me, too. Me, too.
        
        I want to order some ice cream for my
        daughter, please. What would you like,
        Margot?
        
        Your brother’s all torn up inside.
        
        Can’t someone be a shit their whole life
        and want to repair the damage? I mean,
        I think people want to hear that.
        
        (pause)
        It’s a trick question. You don’t have
        one.
        
        (surprised)
        That was my mother’s name.
        
        Anybody feel like grabbing a couple of
        burgers and hitting the cemetery?
        
        I got you something, Ethel. Actually, I
        made it.
        
        A divorce.
        
        Yes.
        
        This is Sanchez. He’s a notary public.
        
        If you’ll just sign here, please, Ethel.
        
        And here.
        
        And initial here.
        
        You own this building, don’t you, Henry?
        It’s magnificent. I used to be a homeowner
        myself, but my son expropriated it
        from me.
        
        Here comes my bus. Thanks, Sanchez.
        
        Almost. Sanchez just has to file the
        papers.
        
        I love you, Etheline. And
        congratulations, both of you.
        
        I didn’t think so much of him at first,
        but now I get it. He’s everything I’m
        not.
        
        Take back Pagoda, will you?
        
        <br>
        ETHELINE TENENBAUM 
        What’s this?
        
        From you?
        
        Are we divorced?
        
        <br>
        HENRY SHERMAN 
        (hesitates)
        Hello.
        
        <br>
        MARGOT TENENBAUM 
        I told you. Nothing. I only have five
        minutes.
        
        I’ll have a butterscotch sundae, I
        guess.
        
        (hesitates)
        Well, so am I, but I’m not going to
        discuss it with you.
        
        Do they?
        
        You probably don’t even know my middle
        name.
        
        Helen.
        
        (sadly)
        I know it was.
        
        <br>
        RICHIE TENENBAUM 
        It doesn’t matter.
        
        So you’re elevator operators now.
        
        What made you decide to do that?
        
        You asked me why I choked out there that
        day.
        
        Well, I think I know the answer, and I
        wanted your advice.
        
        Yeah.
        
        Since always,
        
        Un-huh.
        
        I think she feels confused.
        
        I don’t think so. We’re not related by
        blood.
        
        (pause)
        That’s OK.
        
        Sure, I do.
        
        I know you do, Pop.
        
        Mordecai?
        You came back.
        
        I’m not so sure this is Mordecai.
        
        Yeah, but now he has white feathers on
        his neck.
        
        I need your help with something else.
        
        Well, I think --
        
        (hesitates)
        I didn’t mean right this second.
        
        We want to take you to get some help.
        
        (hesitates)
        Nothing.
        
        Where’s Sabrina?
        
        Are we still friends?
        
        Are we?
        
        It doesn’t matter. I heard about you
        and Margot.
        
        You don’t have to say anything.
        
        (pause)
        But you didn’t have a drug problem then.
        
        <br>
        ELI CASH 
        Yes?
        
        Hey, Richie.
        
        (pause)
        Is it just you guys?
        
        I guess Margot and your mother couldn’t
        make it.
        
        What happened there?
        
        (pause)
        They went back to England.
        
        What do you mean?
        
        Of course. I can’t believe you would
        ask me that.
        
        I’m sorry. I don’t know what to say.
        
        I always wanted to be a Tenenbaum, you
        know?
        
        But it doesn’t mean what it used to,
        does it?
        
        I wish you’d’ve done this for me when I
        was a kid.
        
        Yeah, but it still would’ve meant a lot
        to me. Anyway, I really appreciate your
        coming over here now. I do recognize
        that I have a problem, and I want to get
        better. Let me just get my things.
        
        <br>
        PAGODA 
        There he goes.
        
        <br>
        SANCHEZ ([ublic sttorney)
        Hello, sir.
        
        You’re welcome.
