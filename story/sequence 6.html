    <p>A huge building that looks like a castle. A sign next to the
        door says “375th Street Y.”
        
        An extremely small room with a low ceiling and a single bed.
        Royal stands in front of a mirror while Pagoda stitches up
        the knife-wound in his side. He holds a bottle of iodine in
        one hand and a box of bandages in the other.
        <br>
        ROYAL TENENBAUM 
        Everyone’s against me.
        
        I know. But, dammit, I want to be loved
        by this family.
        
        How much money you got?
        
        (frowns)
        What do you mean? You’re broke?
        
        You got to be kidding me. How’re we
        supposed to pay for the damn room?
        
        All right. We’ll figure something out.
        
        Richie?
        
        Where’re you going?
        
        I have to say, he didn’t look half bad
        for a suicide. Attempted suicide,
        anyway.
        
        <br>
        ETHELINE TENENBAUM 
        Yes, please.
        
        Maybe we’re rushing things, Henry.
        
        OK.
        
        Actually, I should go.
        
        No, I think you’re right. I should go.
        
        Are you in any pain?
        
        Don’t press him right now.
        
        All right. That’s enough. The doctor
        said to let him sleep.
        
        What’s he talking about?
        
        Oh, my goodness.
        
        How long have you been a smoker?
        
        Well, I think you should quit.
        
        Richie Tenenbaum, please.
        
        Royal Tenenbaum.
        
        (hesitates)
        Why? What does it say there? They
        don’t want me?
        
        I think if we shimmy up that gutter and
        jump across the window ledge we can pry
        open the ventilation shaft and --
        
        <br>
        HENRY SHERMAN 
        Would you like another glass of wine?
        
        You’re right. It’s awkward sitting here
        in our pajamas and everything. We don’t
        have to do this right now. Let’s just
        try and have a nice time.
        
        Yes, I think we’re both a little uneasy,
        and there’s no need for us to force
        anything. There’s no hurry. Let’s just
        -
        
        Can I, at least, offer you some dessert?
        
        How can I help?
        
        <br>
        CHAS TENENBAUM 
        Why’d you try to kill yourself?
        
        Can we read it?
        
        Could you paraphrase it for us?
        
        Is it dark?
        
        <br>
        MARGOT TENENBAUM 
        I didn’t know you ever were.
        
        (pause)
        OK.
        
        OK, I’m not in love with you, either.
        
        Do you send my mother your clippings?
        
        And your grades in --
        
        Your reviews aren’t that good.
        
        Where is he, Dudley?
        
        How do you feel?
        
        You did?
        
        I know.
        
        I’m sorry.
        
        It doesn’t matter.
        
        What?
        
        You don’t smoke.
        
        (pause)
        Twenty-two years.
        
        Who’s there?
        
        Hello?
        
        (hesitates)
        Just listening to some records.
        
        I thought you were supposed to be in the
        hospital.
        
        Well, shouldn’t you be on some kind of
        suicide watch or something?
        
        How many stitches did you get?
        
        Jesus, Richie. That looks horrible.
        
        (pause)
        Desmond?
        
        Yeah. I met him in the ocean. I was
        swimming, and he came out to me in a
        canoe. We were only married for nine
        days.
        
        (sighs)
        I know. Poor Eli. Anyway, we mostly
        just talked about you.
        
        Yeah. I guess that was the attraction,
        if you know what I mean.
        
        What’s that?
        
        (sadly)
        I love you, too.
        
        Let’s lie down for a minute.
        
        This is the one we took to the museum,
        isn’t it?
        
        Why’d you do it? Because of me?
        
        You’re not going to do it again, are
        you?
        
        I think we’re just going to have to be
        secretly in love with each other and
        leave it at that, Richie.
        
        <br>
        RICHIE TENENBAUM 
        I’m going to kill myself tomorrow.
        
        Fine, thanks.
        
        Not really.
        
        I wrote a suicide note.
        
        Yeah. Right after I regained
        consciousness.
        
        No.
        
        I don’t think so.
        
        Of course it’s dark. It’s a suicide
        note.
        
        What are you doing in my tent?
        
        I checked myself out.
        
        (pause)
        Probably.
        
        I don’t know. You want to see?
        
        I heard about your ex-husband.
        
        (hesitates)
        I guess so. I didn’t get his name.
        
        (nods)
        And I heard about Eli.
        
        (surprised)
        You did?
        
        I have to tell you something.
        
        I love you.
        
        I can’t stop thinking about you. I went
        away for a year, and it only got worse.
        I don’t know what to do.
        
        Yeah, but it’s not your fault.
        
        (pause)
        I doubt it.
        
        <br>
        ELI CASH 
        I’m not in love with you any more.
        
        Let’s not make this any more difficult
        than it already is.
        
        OK, what?
        
        I know. You’re in love with Richie.
        Which is sick and gross.
        
        Please, stop ridiculing me.
        
        You never gave me the time of day until
        I started getting good reviews.
        
        But the sales are.
        
        <br>
        RALEIGH ST. CLAIR 
        Very little, I assure you.
        
        We would, rather. Yes.
        
        She smokes.
        
        No.
        
        You’ve made a cuckold of me.
        
        Many times over.
        
        And you’ve nearly killed your poor
        brother.
        
        She’s balling Eli Cash.
        
        May I have a cigarette?
        
        Shall I repeat the question?
        
        (bitterly)
        I bloody well know that.
        
        And a light, please?
        
        Thank you.
        
        <br>
        PAGODA 
        You can’t blame them, man.
        
        I don’t have.
        
        There he is, man.
        
        
        <br>
        DETECTIVE
        How much do you already know, gentlemen?
        
        Would you like to examine the report?
        
        Yes.
        <br>
        DUDLEY
        You want to play some word games or do
        some experiments on me or anything?
        
        Who?
        
        <br>
        Manager
        All right. Everything seems to be in
        order. I’ll contact you in the next
        twenty-four hours.
        
        I’ll inform you of my decision at the
        appropriate time.
        <br>
        DUSTY
        I already did.
        
        <br>
        DOCTOR
        He’ll probably sleep for several hours,
        and then I’ll come back to check on him.
        <br>
        NURSE
        Your name?
        
        I’m afraid visiting hours are over, sir.
        
        I’m sorry. I have to refer you to Dr.
        Burroughs. He’ll be in tomorrow
        afternoon.
