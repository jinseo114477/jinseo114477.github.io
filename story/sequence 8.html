    <p>An invitation to Etheline’s and Henry’s wedding at the house
        on Archer Avenue. It is nearly identical to the invitation
        on the cover of the first edition of The Royal Tenenbaums.
        
        Ari, Uzi and Pagoda stand in front of the house with Buckley,
        receiving the wedding guests. They help people out of their
        cars, give them programs for the ceremony, and direct them to
        the front door.
        
        There are about fifty guests. Half of them are black and
        half are white. The members of the wedding party are dressed
        in morning suits.
        Royal and Dusty get out of a gypsy cab. Royal smiles at Ari
        and Uzi. He hugs Pagoda and kisses Ari and Uzi on the tops
        of their heads. He looks around. He whispers:
        <br>
        NARRATOR 
        Royal dug a hole for Buckley behind the
        garden shed, and buried him in a canvas
        duffle bag.
        
        Etheline and Henry were married fortyeight
        hours later, in judge’s chambers.
        
        Margot’s new play, The Levinsons in the
        Trees, was produced at the Cavendish
        Theatre.
        
        It ran for just under two weeks and
        received mixed reviews.
        
        Raleigh and Dudley went on a lecture
        tour to eleven universities in the
        promotion of their new book.
        
        Eli checked himself into a
        rehabilitation hospital in North Dakota.
        
        Richie started a programme teaching
        competitive tennis to eight- to twelveyear-
        olds at the 375th Street Y.
        
        Royal had a heart attack at the age of
        sixty-eight.
        
        Chas rode with him in the ambulance, and
        was the only witness to his father’s
        death.
        
        In his will, he stipulated that his
        funeral take place at dusk.

        ROYAL TENENBAUM 
        I got you some jawbreakers.
        
        Well, of course, I’m half Hebrew, but
        the children are three-quarters Mick-
        Catholic.
        
        (pause)
        I believe so. I really don’t know.
        
        Boys!
        
        They’re OK, Chas.
        
        It’s OK. They’re safe.
        
        I think we lost Buckley.
        
        Chas! Wait!
        
        Can I say something to you, Henry?
        
        I’ve been considered an asshole for
        about as long as I can remember. That’s
        just my style. But I’d feel pretty blue
        if I didn’t think you were going to
        forgive me.
        
        Well, I appreciate that.
        
        Can we get into your backyard, ma’am?
        We got a couple of boys out there.
        
        I think he’s part mutt. What kind of
        papers you got for him?
        
        Sparkplug. Sit.
        
        I got you a new dog for the boys.
        
        I just bought him.
        
        I’m sorry I let you down, Chas. All of
        you. I’ve been trying to make it up to
        you.
        
        (quietly)
        Sparkplug.
        
        You’re welcome.
        
        I know you have, Chassie.
        
        All right, boys. Say a prayer --

        ETHELINE TENENBAUM
        What are you chewing on?
        
        Is it working?
        
        What was that?
        
        Oh, my God.
        
        You boys come over here with me.
        
        I know, but there’s nothing we can do
        for him, at the moment.
        
         <br>
        HENRY SHERMAN 
        It’s slightly uneven.
        
        Hello, Richie. This is my son, Walter
        Sherman.
        
        Yes. I’m a widower.
        
        I know you are, Chas.
        
        I don’t think you’re an asshole, Royal.
        You’re just a kind of a son of a bitch.
        
        It doesn’t matter. It’s still best to
        file under force majeure and recoup the
        deductible.
        
        So help me God.
        
        
        <br>
        CHAS TENENBAUM 
        Henry’s your dad?
        
        So you’ve been married before?
        
        Oh, yeah. I forgot.
        (pause)
        You know, I’m a widower myself.
        
        Where are you?
        
        What?
        
        He did?
        
        Eli!
        
        Yeah.
        
        Yeah.
        
        So do I.
        
        What’s this?
        
        You did?
        
        What’s his name?
        
        Thank you.
        
        We’ve had a rough year, Dad.

        MARGOT TENENBAUM 
        My nicotine inhaler. It’s supposed to
        help me quit.
        
        Not really.
        
        Eli just crashed his car into the front
        of the house.
        
        I wonder what happened to him.
        
        Well, I’m sure he’ll get over it.
        
        This was one of my first hiding places.
        
        I’d say about ten years.
        
        <br>
        RICHIE TENENBAUM 
        Henry?
        
        Nice to meet you, Walter.
        
        He saved them. Kind of.
        
        Chas! Don’t!
        
        Chas?
        
        Not really.
        
        I don’t know.
        (pause)
        Sometimes when people have a traumatic
        experience, their hair turns white.
        How old you think those are?
        
        Rod Laver used it. You know who Laver
        is?
        
        <br>
        ELI CASH 
        Here I come.
        
        Where are my shoes?
        
        Did I hit anybody?
        
        Is everybody okay?
        
        Help! Please!
        
        Did I hit the dog?
        
        (pause)
        Is he dead?
        
        (pause)
        I need help.
        
        At which point I apparently lost control
        of the vehicle, smashed it into the
        house, and killed that poor dog.
        
        (pause)
        I am, indeed.
        
        (touched)
        How sweet of you to say so.
        
        This is my sponsor, Runs with Two
        Horses.

        RALEIGH ST. CLAIR 
        That’s not terribly serious, is it?
        (to the priest)
        Do you have an alternative?
        
        What’s so funny, Dudley?
        
        Oh, my Lord, no.
        
        <br>
        DUDLEY
        You look great!
        
        <br>
        PAGODA 
        This is the quail’s egg.
        <br>
        DUSTY
        Can you see out of it?
        
        Uh-huh. Minor corneal damage. Page me
        if it spreads to the other eye.
        
        <br>
        ARI TENENBAUM 
        Dad, they ran over Buckley.
        
        But Buckley’s still under there.
        
        Dear Heavenly Father --

        You’re Eli Cash.
        
        I love your work.

        I think he may’ve broken his ankle.
        <br>
        WALTER
        Nice to meet you.
        
        Go around to the other side!
        
        But these aren’t structure-bearing
        elements, Dad.
