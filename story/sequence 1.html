    <p>Royal’s suite at the Lindbergh Palace Hotel. There are
        shelves full of law books and hundreds of spy novels in
        stacks on the floor. There is a set of Encyclopedia
        Britannica, an exercise bicycle and a Xerox machine.
        Royal lies on his stomach on a massage table getting a
        massage from a young Asian woman. The manager of the hotel
        stands in front of Royal with a piece of paper in his hand.
        <br>
        NARRATOR 
        Royal had lived in the Lindbergh Palace
        Hotel for twenty-two years.
        
        He was a prominent litigator until the
        mid-eighties, when he was disbarred and
        briefly imprisoned.
        
        No one in his family had spoken to him
        in three years.
        
        Richie had retired from professional
        tennis at twenty-six. His last match
        had been widely discussed in the media.
        
        For the past year he had been traveling
        alone on an ocean liner called the Cote
        d’Ivoire and had seen both poles, five
        oceans, the Amazon and the Nile.
        Eli was an assistant professor of
        English Literature at Brooks College.
        The recent publication of his second
        novel –
        
        -- had earned him a sudden, unexpected
        literary celebrity.
        
        Margot was married to the writer and
        neurologist Raleigh St. Clair.
        
        She was known for her extreme secrecy.
        For example, none of the Tenenbaums knew
        she was a smoker, which she had been
        since the age of twelve.
        
        Nor were they aware of her first
        marriage and divorce to a recording
        artist in Jamaica.
        
        She kept a private studio in Mockingbird
        Heights under the name Helen Scott.
        
        She had not completed a play in seven
        years.
        
        Raleigh’s next book was on the subject
        of a condition he called Heinsbergen’s
        Syndrome.
        
        Chas’ wife, Rachael, was killed in a
        plane crash the previous summer.
        
        Chas and their two sons, Ari and Uzi,
        were also on the flight and survived, as
        did their dog, who was discovered in his
        cage several thousand yards from the
        crash site.
        
        Over the last six months, he had become
        increasingly concerned with their
        safety.
        
        Etheline became an archaeologist and had
        overseen excavations for the Department
        of Housing and the Transit Authority.
        
        She taught bridge class twice a week
        with her friend and business manager,
        Henry Sherman.
        
        Since her separation from her husband,
        she had had many suitors –
        
        -- but had not considered a single one
        until this moment.

        ROYAL TENENBAUM 
        What about Sing-Sang? I owe her a
        hundred.
        
        Thanks, Dusty.
        
        Who is it?
        
        I’ll take it in there.
        
        What do you got?
        
        (quietly)
        No shit? And what’d Ethel say?
        
        I don’t like the sound of this one damn
        bit, Pagoda. I mean, Lord knows I’ve
        had my share of infidelities. But she’s
        still my wife.
        (pause)
        And no goddamn two-bit chartered
        accountant’s going to change that.
        
        <br>
        ETHELINE TENENBAUM 
        What do you mean?
        
        (pause)
        But I thought it was --
        
        Yes?
        
        No, I didn’t.
        
        This isn’t really a tax issue, is it?
        
        Let me think about it, Henry.
        
        <br>
        CHAS TENENBAUM 
        Fire alarm! Ari! Uzi! Let’s go! Look
        alive!
        
        Uzi! Let’s go!
        
        No elevators! There’s a fire!
        
        You forgot him.
        
        Four minutes and forty-eight seconds.
        We’re all dead. Burned to a crisp.
        
        It doesn’t matter.
        
        <br>
        UZI TENENBAUM
        What about Buckley?
        
        We left Buckley.
        
        <br>
        MARGOT TENENBAUM 
        Well, I just don’t use that word
        lightly.
        
        I have to go, Eli.
        
        Uh-huh?
        
        Fine, thank you.
        
        <br>
        RICHIE TENENBAUM 
        Read it back to me so far, Pietro.
        
        New paragraph.
        
        Your friend, Richie. End of letter.
        
        <br>
        ELI CASH 
        The crickets and the rust-beetles
        scuttled among the nettles of the
        sagethicket. Vamanos, amigos, he
        whispered, and threw the busted leather
        flintscraw over the loose weave of the
        saddlecock. And they rode on in the
        friscalating dusklight.
        
        Well, everyone knows Custer died at
        Little Bighorn. What this book
        presupposes is:
        (tentatively)
        maybe he didn’t?
        
        Let me ask you something. Why would a
        reviewer make the point of saying
        someone’s not a genius? I mean, do you
        think I’m especially not a genius?
        Isn’t that --
        
        You didn’t even have to think about it,
        did you?
        
        <br>
        HENRY SHERMAN 
        Apropos of my question re: I-40 slash I-
        9 adjustments.
        
        It would probably be advantageous for
        your marital status to be legally
        established as single, in light of the
        circumstances.
        
        I mean for tax purposes.
        
        Etheline?
        
        Will you marry me?
        Pagoda stops peeling the potatoes
        
        I love you. Did you already know that?
        
        (pause)
        That’s true. I don’t know why I put it
        that way.

        RALEIGH ST. CLAIR 
        Margot?
        
        May I come in, please?
        
        How are you, my darling?
        
        Seventeen October. Third examination of
        Dudley Heinsbergen.
        
        All right, Dudley. Make yours look like
        mine.
        
        My goodness. How interesting. How
        bizarre.
        
        Dudley suffers from a rare disorder
        combining the symptoms of amnesia,
        dyslexia and color-blindness, with a
        highly acute sense of hearing.
        
        There is also evidence of --
        
        I’m afraid you are.
        
        <br>
        DUDLEY
        Done.
        
        I’m not color-blind, am I?
        
        <br>
        DUSTY
        You’re welcome.
        
        <br>
        PAGODA 
        Hello, please. Tell Mr. Royal this is
        the Pagoda.
        
        The black man asks her to be his wife.
        
        She thinks about it.

        MANAGER
        I’ve been instructed to refuse any
        further charges on your room account and
        to direct you in writing to please
        vacate the premises by the end of the
        month.
        
        Can you pay her in cash?

        Dear Eli, I’m in the middle of the
        ocean. I haven’t left my room in four
        days. I’ve never been more lonely in my
        life, and I think I’m in love with
        Margot.
        <br>
        BELLBOY
        There’s a call for you, Mr. Tenenbaum.
        
        A Mr. Pagoda.
