    <p>The side entrance of the hotel. Royal goes in through
        revolving doors.
        
        Royal comes into the lobby and freezes.
        
        A large number of trunks, suitcases and boxes are stacked and
        piled on four carts next to the front desk. There are also
        several dozen hanging garments on a rack with wheels on it.
        A bellboy rolls a fifth cart next to the others. The manager
        and his assistant come over and watch Royal study his
        possessions. Royal says suddenly:
        
        <br>
        ROYAL TENENBAUM
        Where’re my encyclopedias?
        
        (shaking his head)
        Damn you. You’re taking my
        encyclopedias. This is humiliating.
        
        Where am I supposed to go? You’re
        turning me into a goddamn hobo.
        
        You son of a bitch.
        
        Hello, Dusty.
        
        Spot me a quarter, will you?
        Richie? It’s your dad.
        
        All right. Let me just collect my
        things.
        
        Would you mind handing me my cane,
        Richie?
        
        Let’s see, now. Where’s my suitcase?
        
        Grab me a Nembutal, son.
        
        Fuck do you care?
        
        Pagoda. Call Dr. McClure.
        
        Pagoda is in possession of a parcel that
        contains my will and some instructions
        regarding the funeral, including my
        epitaph, for when the time comes.
        
        Proof-read it for me before they carve
        it on the headstone, OK?
        
        I never did stop loving you, by the way.
        Do you believe that?
        
        You look terrific. That dress is
        stunning.
        
        I was going to read for a little bit,
        Chas.
        
        I’m in the middle of a sentence.
        
        Goodnight, m’boy.
        
        What’s that jackass doing here?
        
        I know you, asshole!
        
        I don’t like the way you’re treating
        Raleigh.
        
        I’ve met him. And I don’t think he
        deserves --
        
        You’re two-timing him with that
        bloodsucker Eli Cash.
        
        It’s not right, dammit. You used to be
        a genius.
        
        (hesitates)
        Well, anyway, that’s what they used to
        say.
        
        Let’s go down to Little Tokyo and get
        some firecrackers.
        
        (hesitates)
        Nothing. You got them crunching numbers
        for you, huh?
        
        Chassie’s got those boys cooped up like
        a pair of jackrabbits, Ethel.
        
        I know it. But you can’t raise boys to
        be scared of life. You got to brew some
        recklessness into them.
        
        (pause)
        No, you don’t.
        
        I’m not talking about dance lessons.
        I’m talking about putting a brick
        through the other guy’s windshield. I’m
        talking about taking it out and chopping
        it up.
        
        (indicating Pagoda)
        He saved my life, you know. Thirty
        years ago. I was knifed at a bazaar in
        Calcutta, and he carried me to the
        hospital on his back.
        
        He did. There was a price on my head,
        and he was a hired assassin. Stuck me
        in the gut with a shiv.
        
        Just stepped out to get some air. How’s
        the --
        
        Holy shit. That’s not -- What is that?
        
        No. That’s dog’s blood.
        
        (looking around)
        My God. I haven’t been in here in
        years.
        
        Yes, I am. And I think you’re having a
        nervous breakdown. I don’t believe
        you’ve recovered from Rachael’s death.
        I think --
        
        There you are.
        
        Oh, I’m having a ball. Scrapping and
        yelling. Mixing it up. Loving every
        minute with this damn crew.
        (sincerely)
        I’d like to thank you for raising our
        children, by the way.
        
        I’m not kidding.
        
        You always put them first, didn’t you?
        
        Goddammit, don’t do that to yourself.
        I’m the one who failed them. Or,
        anyway, it’s nobody’s fault.
        (pause)
        Plus, it doesn’t --
        
        I don’t know, but I’m ashamed of myself.
        I’ll tell you one thing, though. You’ve
        got more grit, and fire, and guts than
        any bob-tailed fox I ever damn hunted,
        and if --
        
        What? What’s so funny?
        
        No, tell me.
        
        (pause)
        I don’t know what you’re talking about.
        But I’ll take it as a compliment.
        
        You’re true blue, Ethel. You really
        are.
        
        How’s your love life?
        
        <br>
        ARI TENENBAUM 
        (to Richie)
        Where are you going to sleep?
        
        We don’t mind, Dad. We like him.
        
        We take boxing and self-defense class.
        
        What do you mean?
        
        Who stabbed you?
        
        <br>
        UZI TENENBAUM
        We brought an extra sleeping bag you can
        use.
        
        You want to borrow our electric –
        
        Who? Pappy?
        
        <br>
        ETHELINE TENENBAUM 
        Have you spoken to him about this?
        
        Call him Henry.
        
        You’ve known him for ten years.
        
        Nor is it yours.
        
        Oh, my goodness!
        
        OK.
        
        Not really.
        
        Thanks.
        
        (nods)
        He always sends me his clippings.
        
        I think he just likes the encouragement.
        He’s done it for years. He used to send
        me his grades in college.
        
        He has his reasons.
        
        I think that’s terrible advice.
        
        How are you feeling?
        
        (pause)
        OK.
        
        I tried to. Lately, I feel like maybe I
        didn’t do such a great job.
        
        Well, then why didn’t you give a damn
        about us, Royal? Why didn’t you care?
        
        Nothing.
        
        Nothing. Just these little expressions
        of yours.
        
        None of your business.
        
        <br>
        HENRY SHERMAN 
        All right. Let’s not get out of hand.
        
        Please, call me Henry.
        <br>
        CHAS TENENBAUM 
        I’m sorry. Maybe I’m a little confused.
        What are you suggesting?
        
        That he come here and stay in my room.
        
        Who gives a shit?
        
        You poor sucker. You poor, washed-up
        poppa’s boy.
        
        Don’t get in the middle of this, Mr.
        Sherman. This is a family matter.
        
        I prefer Mr. Sherman.
        
        Why? I don’t know him that well.
        
        As your accountant, Mr. Sherman, yes.
        
        Uzi.
        
        It’s not your decision, goddammit.
        
        Get out.
        
        Are you OK?
        
        Can we move him?
        
        For how long?
        
        Lights out, old man.
        
        Sorry. 11:30. Lights out.
        
        Have to finish it up in the morning.
        Them’s the rules.
        
        Looks like you and Dad are back together
        again, huh?
        
        No, he’s not.
        (pause)
        You really hate me, don’t you?
        
        Well, I don’t know what you think you’re
        going to get out of this. But believe
        me, whatever it is, it’s not worth it.
        
        (gritting his teeth)
        Stop saying that.
        
        What do you need?
        
        Please, don’t come in this room.
        
        Where’ve you been?
        
        (concerned)
        What’s that?
        
        Stay away from my children. Do you
        understand?
        
        (screams)
        Are you listening to me?
        
        <br>
        MARGOT TENENBAUM 
        Don’t talk to him like that.
        
        Did Eli send you that?
        
        (incredulous)
        What for?
        
        (frowns)
        That’s ridiculous.
        
        I don’t know.
        
        (pause)
        Maybe not. But --
        
        No. But --
        
        Raleigh, please. For God’s sake.
        
        (pause)
        I couldn’t begin to even think about
        knowing how to answer that question.
        
        What are you talking about? You don’t
        even know him.
        
        Stay out of it.
        
        No, I didn’t.
        
        <br>
        RICHIE TENENBAUM 
        I think he’s very lonely. Lonelier than
        he lets on, and maybe lonelier than he
        even realizes.
        
        Briefly. And he agreed that --
        
        That he come here and stay in my room.
        
        (sincerely)
        No, I’m not. Anyway, I think he’d be
        much more comfortable here than --
        
        I do.
        
        I’ll just camp out upstairs.
        
        Oh, that’s OK. I’ve got an old Scout
        cot and a couple of army blankets.
        
        Well, he’s already up there.
        
        I think he’s asleep, because of the
        medication he’s on. But I guess you can
        wake him up and throw him out, if Mom
        says it’s OK.
        
        Dad?
        
        Mom!
        
        Is he going to be all right?
        
        Yeah.
        
        (pause)
        He’s your dad, too, Chas.
        
        (puzzled)
        No, I don’t. I love you.
        
        I don’t want to hurt you, Chas. I know
        what you and the boys have been through.
        You’re my brother, and I love you.
        
        I doubt it.
        
        (pause)
        OK.
        
        I don’t know. What do you want to do?
        
        Find the guy and get him?
        
        Who do you think it might be?
        
        <br>
        RALEIGH ST. CLAIR
        How long do you intend to stay here?
        
        Are you ever coming home?
        
        You’re joking.
        
        I want to die.
        
        Have you met someone else?
        
        Richard, I know you’re terribly close to
        Margot, and perhaps you understand her
        better than anyone else.
        
        Nevertheless, may I confide in you?
        
        I believe she’s having an affair.
        
        I’m utterly devastated. I don’t know
        where else to turn. Will you advise me?
        
        Well, I thought, perhaps --
        
        (pause)
        Well, no. I thought we might --
        Richie punches his hand through the attic window
        
        (hesitates)
        I don’t know, at the moment.
        
        <br>
        DUSTY 
        Hello, sir.
        
        Of course.
        
        His condition is stable. The attack was
        just a side-effect. I recommend that
        you push fluids and continue the stomach
        cancer medication.
        
        Absolutely not.
        
        We’ll have to wait and see.
        
        That depends. Is he a fighter?
        
        (solemnly)
        Then that’s the best we’ve got. Now, if
        you’ll excuse me, I have another call to
        make.
        
        <br>
        MANAGER
        They’ve been placed in storage.
        
        I’m sorry. Would you like to --
        
        I’d be happy to make a reservation for
        you at another hotel.
        
        Frederick?
