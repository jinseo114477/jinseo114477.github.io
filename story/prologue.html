    <p>Prologue
        <br>
        Royal sits at the head of a long table. He is surrounded by
        his children.
        
        Chas is twelve, with curly hair, dressed in a black suit and
        tie. Margot is ten, with a barrette in her hair, wearing a
        knitted LaCoste dress and penny loafers. Richie is eight,
        with long hair, parted on the side, dressed in a Bjorn Borgstyle
        tennis outfit with a headband.
        Chas wears a blank expression, Margot looks as if she is
        about to cry, and Richie has tears all over his face.

        NARRATOR 
        Royal Tenenbaum bought the house on
        Archer Avenue in the winter of his
        thirty-fifth year.
        
        Over the next decade, he and his wife
        had three children and then they
        separated.
        
        They were never legally divorced.
        
        Etheline Tenenbaum kept the house and
        raised the children, and their education
        was her highest priority.
        
        She wrote a book on the subject.
        
        Chas Tenenbaum had, since elementary
        school, taken most of his meals in his
        room, standing up at his desk with a cup
        of coffee, to save time.
        
        In the sixth grade, he went into
        business, breeding dalmation mice, which
        he sold to a pet shop in Little Tokyo.
        
        He started buying real estate in his
        early teens and seemed to have an almost
        preternatural understanding of
        international finance.
        
        He negotiated the purchase of his
        father’s summer house on Eagle’s Island.
        
        The BB was still lodged between two
        knuckles in Chas’ left hand.
        
        Margot Tenenbaum was adopted at the age
        of two. Her father had always noted
        this when introducing her.
        
        She was a playwright and won a Braverman
        Grant of fifty-thousand dollars in the
        ninth grade.
        
        She and her brother Richie ran away from
        home one winter and camped out in the
        African Wing of the Public Archives.
        
        Four years later, she disappeared alone
        for almost two weeks and came back with
        half a finger missing.
        
        Richie Tenenbaum had been a champion
        tennis player since the third grade.
        
        He turned pro at seventeen and won the
        U.S. Nationals three years in a row.
        
        He kept a studio in the corner of the
        ballroom but had failed to develop as a
        painter.
        
        On weekends, Royal took him on outings
        around the city.
        
        These invitations were never extended to
        anyone else.
        
        Richie’s best friend Eli Cash lived with
        his aunt in a building across the
        street.
        
        He was a regular fixture at family
        gatherings, holidays, mornings before
        school and most afternoons.
        
        The three Tenenbaum children performed
        Margot’s first play on the night of her
        eleventh birthday.
        
        They had agreed to invite their father
        to the party.
        
        He had not been invited to any of their
        parties since.
        
        In fact, virtually all memory of the
        brilliance of the young Tenenbaums had
        been erased by two decades of betrayal,
        failure and disaster.
        <br>        
        ROYAL TENENBAUM 
        (gently)
        At the moment, no. But it doesn’t look
        good.
        
        Of course, I do.
        
        Very much. But she asked me to leave,
        and I had to respect her position on the
        matter.
        
        (long pause)
        No. Obviously, we had to make certain
        sacrifices as a result of having
        children, but no. Lord, no.
        
        (sadly)
        I don’t really know any more. Maybe I
        wasn’t as true to her as I could’ve
        been.
        
        Let’s not rehash it, Chassie.
        
        Thanks, Pagoda.
        
        Hold it, Chassie.
        
        (hesitates)
        There are no teams.
        
        This is my adopted daughter, Margot
        Tenenbaum.
        
        Vamanos! Andale!
        
        It didn’t seem believable to me.
        
        Why are you wearing pajamas? Do you
        live here?
        
        What characters? It was just a bunch of
        little kids dressed in animal costumes.
        
        Sweetie. Don’t get mad. That’s just
        one man’s opinion.
        
        <br>
        ETHELINE TENENBAUM 
        I’ll hold, thank you.
        
        (pause)
        Write yourself a check.
        
        Bene. Si. Grazie mille.
        
        <br>
        CHAS TENENBAUM 
        (pointedly)
        Do you still love Mom?
        
        Well, she says –
        
        I need $187.
        
        The gentleman in the blue cardigan,
        please.
        
        Go ahead.
        
        What are you doing? You’re on my team!
        
        What’d you think, Dad?
        
        Did you think the characters were --
        
        <br>
        MARGOT TENENBAUM 
        Are you getting divorced?
        
        Was it our fault?
        
        Goodnight, everyone.
        
        <br>
        RICHIE TENENBAUM 
        Do you still love us?
        
        Why’d she ask you to leave?
        
        Hi, Eli.
        
        He has permission to sleep over.
        
        Go, Mordecai.
        
        <br>
        ELI CASH 
        You said I could run away, too.
        <br>
        REPORTER
        Thank you. I have a two-part question.
