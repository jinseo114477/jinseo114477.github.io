    <p>Snow falls lightly, and the sky is getting dark. Everyone in
        the family is gathered around as Chas, Richie, Henry,
        Raleigh, Eli, Dusty and Pagoda lower the casket. They are
        all bundled up in coats and scarves. They step away from the
        grave.
        <br>
        Henry stands next to Etheline. She takes his arm. Pagoda
        wears Royal’s sunglasses. Tears stream down his face. Dusty
        stands beside him. Margot has her arm around Richie’s
        shoulder. She smokes a cigarette. Raleigh stands next to
        Dudley. Eli stands next to Walter. The priest is on
        crutches.
        <br>
        Chas looks to Ari and Uzi standing a few yards away. He
        nods. Ari and Uzi fire several shots into the air with Chas’
        and Royal’s old BB guns.
        <br>
        Royal’s gravestone sits in a wheelbarrow next to a pile of
        dirt. It reads “Royal O’Reilly Tenenbaum (1932-2001).”
        Epitaph: “Died tragically rescuing his family from the
        wreckage of a destroyed sinking battleship.” The priest sees
        this and hesitates. He looks puzzled. He smiles slightly.
        <br>
        Richie throws a white flower into the grave. They all stand
        in silence for a minute before they turn away and walk to
        their waiting car.
