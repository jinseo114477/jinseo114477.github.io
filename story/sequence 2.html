    <p>The doorbell rings. Pagoda comes into the hallway and opens
        the front door. Uzi is on the steps with a duffel bag over
        his shoulder and a stack of coloring books under his arm.
        Buckley is at his side. Buckley has a cold and coughs often.
        There is a silver BMW parked at the curb with three doors and
        the trunk open. Chas, Ari and a uniformed driver are
        unpacking suitcases, blankets, boxes, clothes, toys, boxing
        gloves and a computer. The driver is Anwar.
        Chas, Ari and Uzi all wear red Adidas warm-ups.

        NARRATOR
        That night, Etheline found all of her
        children living together under the same
        roof for the first time in seventeen
        years.
        
        The next morning Richie woke at dawn.
        He had decided birds should not be kept
        in cages, fed Mordecai three sardines,
        and set him free.

        ROYAL TENENBAUM 
        What kind of side effects can be
        expected?
        
        You mean like flopping around on the
        floor and everything?
        
        You got a minute?
        
        I need a favor. I want to spend some
        time with you and the children.
        
        Now, hold on, dammit.
        
        I want my family back.
        
        I’m dying, baby.
        
        I’m sick as a dog. I’ll be dead in six
        weeks. I’m dying.
        
        Take it easy, Ethel.
        
        Hold on. Hold on.
        
        Wait a second.
        
        Listen. I’m not dying. But I need some
        time.
        
        A month. Maybe two. I want us to --
        
        Ethel.
        
        Baby. I am dying.
        
        (pause)
        Dying? Yes.
        
        
        ETHELINE TENENBAUM
        Chas?
        
        What’s going on?
        
        Did you call a locksmith?
        
        (pause)
        I don’t understand. Did you pack your
        bags before you got locked out? Or how
        did you --
        
        Excuse me for a moment, please.
        
        But there’s no sprinklers here, either.
        
        It’s me, sweetie.
        
        Raleigh says you’ve been spending six
        hours a day locked in here watching
        television and soaking in the tub.
        
        Well, I don’t think that’s very healthy,
        do you? Nor do I think it’s very
        intelligent to keep an electrical gadget
        on the edge of the bathtub.
        
        Well, it can’t be very good for your
        eyes, anyway.
        
        Chas came home.
        
        He and Ari and Uzi are going to stay
        with me for a little while.
        
        (hesitates)
        Well, I don’t know, exactly. But I
        think he’s been very depressed ever
        since --
        
        (pause)
        So are you what?
        
        What are you doing here?
        
        Are you crazy?
        
        Stop following me.
        
        Well, you can’t have it. I’m sorry for
        you, but it’s too late.
        
        What are you talking about?
        
        What happened?
        
        Oh, my God.
        
        I’m sorry. I didn’t know.
        
        What’d they say? What’s the prognosis?
        
        What are you talking about?
        
        (urgently)
        Where’s the doctor? Let’s get --
        
        What’s wrong with you?
        
        Go away!
        
        Are you or aren’t you?
        
        More or less.
        
        Hard to say.
        
        <br>
        HENRY SHERMAN 
        Have you told your children?
        
        And are they all right?
        
        <br>
        CHAS TENENBAUM 
        Give us a hand, Pagoda.
        
        We got locked out of our apartment.
        
        (hesitates)
        Uh-huh.
        
        It’s not safe over there.
        
        The apartment. I have to get some new
        sprinklers and a back-up security system
        installed.
        
        Well, we might have to do something
        about that, too.
        
        Isn’t this great? It feels like we’re
        camping.
        
        Who put that in here?
        
        See you in the morning.
        
        You know what? I’m going to sleep in
        here, and that way we can all be
        together.
        
        His name’s Royal Tenenbaum.
        
        (hesitates)
        But now he’s really dying.
        
        <br>
        ARI TENENBAUM 
        When are we going home?
        
        You told us he was already dead.
        
        <br>
        UZI TENENBAUM
        Who’s your father?
        
        <br>
        MARGOT TENENBAUM 
        Who is it?
        
        (pause)
        I doubt that.
        
        I tied it to the radiator.
        
        (pause)
        What do you mean?
        
        (frowns)
        Why are they allowed to do that?
        
        (urgently)
        So am I.
        
        Because I’m in a rut, and I need a
        change. Hang on.
        
        I do, kind of. I can’t explain it right
        now.
        
        (gently)
        I’ll call you, OK?
        
        Hello?
        
        What for?
        
        I don’t think so, Eli.
        
        That’s OK. We’re not actually related,
        anyway.
        
        Stand up straight and let me get a look
        at you.
        
        What’s so funny?
        
        Well, it’s nice to see you, too.
        
        <br>
        RICHIE TENENBAUM
        I’d like to send a response, Alberto.
        
        Dear Mom, I received your message. I’m
        coming home as soon as possible.
        (pause)
        Who do I see about that?
        
        <br>
        ELI CASH 
        Hello, beautiful.
        
        Could we have dinner with your mother
        sometime?
        
        (shrugs)
        I don’t know. I’d just love to see her.
        
        I’m very sorry, Margot.
        
        That’s true.
        
        <br>
        RALEIGH ST. CLAIR
        You have a visitor, my darling.
        
        But why is this bloody necessary?
        
        You don’t love me anymore, do you?
        
        <br>
        DUDLEY
        That taxi has a dent in it.
        Another dent here and another dent
        there.
        
        <br>
        DOCTOR
        Well, there’s a number of possibilities.
        Severe nausea and dizziness are
        standard. A certain percentage of
        patients may also experience seizure.
        
        In some cases.
        
        <br>
        WAITER
        Yes, sir. Go ahead.
