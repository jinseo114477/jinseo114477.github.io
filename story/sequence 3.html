    <p>Royal gets out of a gypsy cab in front of the Tenenbaum
        house. He is dressed in a white bathrobe, white pajamas and
        red bedroom slippers. He carries a cane, but walks across
        the sidewalk quickly and energetically.
        Pagoda waits for him at the top of the steps. They shake
        hands. Silence.
        
        <br>
        ROYAL TENENBAUM
        OK.
        
        I’ve missed the hell out of you, my
        darlings. You know that, don’t you?
        
        So they tell me.
        
        (shrugs)
        I had a good run.
        
        Thank you.
        
        I’ve got a pretty bad case of cancer.
        
        Not long.
        
        About six weeks.
        
        But let me get to the point here. The
        three of you and your mother are all
        I’ve got, and I love you more than
        anything.
        
        Let me finish. Now, I’ve got six weeks
        to set things right with you, and I aim
        to do it. Will you give me a chance?
        
        Do you speak for everyone?
        
        Well, you’ve made your views known. So
        why don’t you let somebody else do some
        of the talking now?
        
        Well, I can’t say, really. Make up for
        lost time, I suppose. But the first
        thing I’d like to do is take you to see
        your grandmother, at some point.
        
        Well, she wasn’t your real grandmother,
        so I didn’t know you’d be interested,
        sweetie. Anyway, you’re invited this
        time.
        
        (pause)
        Who?
        
        Oh. That’s right, isn’t it? Well, we
        can swing by her grave, too.
        
        I’ll be right back.
        
        May I see my grandsons?
        
        Because I’d like to finally meet them.
        
        Don’t give me that guff.
        
        Pagoda! Where’s my javelina?
        
        I’ll say goodnight to you now, children.
        
        Thank you, my sweet boy.
        
        I’ll contact you in the next twelve
        hours and give you further instructions.
        
        Look at that old grizzly bear.
        
        Hello, Ethel! Good evening, sir. Hold
        the cab, please, driver.
        Hey, man. Lay it on me.
        
        (shrugs)
        Ah, what can I say? I’m dying.
        
        I’m just kidding. Goodnight all.
        
        That’s a hell of an old hound dog you
        got there. What’s he go by?
        
        (pointing at Buckley)
        Buckley. Sit.
        
        You know who I am?
        
        I’m Royal. You heard of me?
        
        I’m very sorry for your loss. Your
        mother was a terribly attractive woman.
        
        Which one are you?
        
        (looks to Uzi)
        Uzi, I’m your granddad.
        
        I’m sorry we haven’t gotten to know each
        other. I don’t get invited around much.
        What do you think about that, by the
        way? You don’t have to say anything.
        
        Kind of a fuck-you to the old man, I
        guess.
        
        How’s your daddy?
        
        You think so? How often’s he got you
        working out?
        
        (shakes his head)
        Do me a favor. Tell him you want to
        meet me.
        
        No, we didn’t.
        
        Look. I want us to have a relationship,
        but we’re going to have to pull some
        strings to make that happen.
        (pause)
        Here’s what you tell him...
        
        She was a tough old broad, wasn’t she?
        
        Oh, that’s right. We got another body
        buried out here. Hang on. Take some of
        these.
        
        What do you think of this big old black
        buck moving in up there?
        Henry Sherman. You know him?
        
        Is he worth a damn?
        
        That’s a hell of a damn grave.
        
        I wish it were mine.
        
        It’s a shame, isn’t it?
        
        You probably had another good two to
        three years of competitive play in you.
        
        I had a lot riding on that match, you
        know. Financially and personally.
        
        Why’d you choke out there that day,
        Baumer?
        
        I kind of disappeared after that, didn’t
        I?
        
        You still got that little BB in your
        hand, Chassie?
        
        It was the object of the game, wasn’t
        it?
        
        Were we?
        
        Well, you sued me. Twice. And got me
        disbarred. But I don’t hold it against
        you, do I?
        
        Objection, your honor. Now, dammit --
        
        You think you could start forgiving me?
        
        Because you’re hurting me.
        
        Kind of. Minimum security. I got
        jacked by the IRS. Should we split?
        
        Call me Mr. Tenenbaum.
        
        I’m kidding. Call me Pappy.
        
        Come on! Let’s shag ass!
        
        <br>
        ETHELINE TENENBAUM 
        Royal, this is Henry Sherman.
        
        Don’t pay any attention to that man,
        Henry.
        
        Good. Now I’ll just remove the loose
        soil and note the decomposition levels.
        
        These were probably slaves. Before the
        arrival of the --
        
        Don’t be silly.
        
        Why? I thought it was very sweet.
        
        That’s ridiculous.
        
        Henry, I have no interest in Frank
        Benedict or Doug Cartwright. I never
        did.
        
        And as far as Royal is concerned, he’s
        the most --
        
        Are you all right?
        
        Wait a second, Henry.
        
        I’m sorry. I’m very nervous.
        
        To tell you the truth, I haven’t slept
        with a man in eighteen years.
        
        I think I’m falling for Henry.
        
        What do you think of him?
        
        I’ll tell you a secret. He asked me to
        marry him.
        
        (hesitates)
        Well, I haven’t accepted yet. Besides,
        you already have a father, sweetheart.
        
        <br>
        HENRY SHERMAN 
        How do you do?
        
        I’m sorry to interrupt your work.
        
        I just wanted to apologize for the other
        day. When I proposed to you.
        
        Look. I know I’m not as accomplished as
        some of the men you’ve been involved
        with. Franklin Benedict and General
        Cartwright and your ex-husband and --
        
        But I feel I have just as much to offer
        as any of them. I know I went about it
        backwards, but --
        
        I’m fine. Anyway, let me know when you
        make up your mind.
        
        That’s OK. Thank you. Why are you --
        
        <br>
        CHAS TENENBAUM 
        (yawning)
        How long are you going to last?
        
        A month? A year?
        
        No.
        
        I speak for myself.
        
        My wife.
        
        Chas?
        
        Why?
        
        I think we’ll pass.
        
        I wouldn’t know. Excuse me.
        
        Why’d you shoot me?
        
        No. We were on the same team.
        
        Because I started the corporation when I
        was a minor, so my father was the
        primary signatory on most of my
        accounts.
        
        He also stole bonds out of my safety
        deposit box when I was fourteen.
        
        Why should I?

        ARI TENENBAUM 
        Buckley.
        
        (pause)
        Thank you.
        
        Ari.
        
        Fine.
        
        Sixteen times a week.
        
        I bet Mom would’ve wanted us to meet him
        before he died, wouldn’t she?
        
        Uzi. Shh.
        
        Did you try to sew it back on?
        
        Yes, sir.
        
        Ok.
        
        Ok.
        <br>
        UZI TENENBAUM
        Hello.
        
        But we just met.
        
        What happened to your finger?
        
        How’d it get chopped off by --
        
        Were you in prison?
        
        <br>
        MARGOT TENENBAUM 
        I hear you’re dying.
        
        I’m sorry.
        
        What do you propose to do?
        
        I haven’t been there at all. I was
        never invited.
        
        Thanks.
        
        I’m listening.
        (points to a deli)
        Right there is where you used to go get
        jacked off.
        
        (pause)
        I don’t know. I can’t tell.
        
        (frowns)
        What are you talking about?
        
        What are we doing, Eli?
        
        That’s amazing.
        
        (excited)
        I think he’s gorgeous.
        
        (dreamily)
        I’m going to have a father.
        
        Not really. Plus, now he’s dying.
        
        It got chopped off by an axe.
        
        It’s OK. I’ll tell you. I’m adopted.
        Did you know that?
        
        Well, I am. And I went to find my real
        family when I was fourteen. They live
        in Indiana.
        
        (shakes her head)
        Couldn’t find it.
        
        (pause)
        I don’t know.
        
        OK. Thanks.
        
        By the way, I heard about that letter
        you sent to Eli.
        
        Those aren’t mine.
        
        <br>
        RICHIE TENENBAUM 
        You don’t look so sick, Dad.
        
        What’ve you got?
        
        (pause)
        I haven’t been out there since I was
        six.
        
        You know, Rachael’s buried there, too.
        
        (pause)
        Who?
        
        Yeah.
        
        I believe so.
        
        What?
        
        (shrugs)
        Probably.
        
        (pause)
        I don’t know, Dad.
        
        (shrugs)
        Yeah, but I understood. I know you’re
        not very good with disappointment.
        
        How are you and Raleigh getting along?
        You think you’re going to get back
        together?
        
        Well, if you need someone to talk to,
        let me know, OK? I like Raleigh very
        much. I know he’s a lot older than you
        are, and you’re having some problems,
        but -- Anyway, maybe I can help.
        
        You dropped some cigarettes.
        
        Well, they just fell out of your pocket
        
        Did you tell Margot about that letter I
        wrote you?
        
        Eli, that was meant to be just between
        you and me.
        
        Well, I would ask you the same question.
        
        How’d she break her arm?
        
        (pause)
        Hm?
        
        I didn’t say anything.
        
        Did you say you’re on mescaline?
        
        How often do you --
        
        (pause)
        Why?
        
        Yeah.
        
        (quickly)
        Adopted.
        
        <br>
        ELI CASH 
        Right there is where I used to go get
        jacked off.
        
        You don’t give a shit.
        
        That’s right.
        
        How’s Richie?
        
        Yeah. Me, either. He wrote me a
        letter. He says he’s in love with you.
        
        (shrugs)
        That’s what he said. I don’t know how
        we’re supposed to take it. Hang on.
        
        Sugar, it’s Eli.
        
        I just got to pick something up. Don’t
        repeat that, by the way. About Richie.
        It was told in confidence.
        
        Oh, my Lord. Look at you.
        
        (hesitates)
        Why? Did she mention it?
        
        Yes, I did.
        
        I know. I’m sorry. Why would she have
        repeated that, I wonder?
        
        (pause)
        Rightly so.
        
        Sabrina?
        
        Look what I found on the doorstep.
        
        Charlotte? Stetson? Say hello to Uncle
        Richie.
        
        (sadly)
        I fell down the stairs with her.
        
        That’s Cinnamon. Hello, Cinnamon.
        
        What’d you say?
        
        What?
        
        When? Right now?
        (pause)
        I’m sorry. Don’t listen to me.
        (barely audible)
        I’m on mescaline. I’ve been spaced out
        all day.
        
        (nods)
        I did, indeed. Very much so.
        
        I’m worried about you, Richie.
        
        Well, actually, Margot is, for some
        reason. But I did find it odd when you
        said you were in love with her.
        (pause)
        She’s married, you know.
        
        And she’s your sister.
        
        <br>
        SABRINA
        What?
        
        Hello, darling.
        <br>
        FATHER (Margot’s biological dad)
        Now just set one of them hickory trunks
        right up on top there, sister Maggie.
        <br>
        ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
        That’s seventy-two unforced errors for
        Richie Tenenbaum. He’s playing the
        worst tennis of his life. What’s he
        feeling right now, Tex Hayward?
        
        Who’s he looking at in the friends’ box,
        Tex?
        <br>
        TEX HAYWARD (V.O.)
        I don’t know, Jim. There’s obviously
        something wrong with him. He’s taken
        off his shoes and one of his socks, and -
        - actually, I think he’s crying.
        
        That’s his sister, Margot, and her new
        husband, Raleigh St. Clair. They were
        just married yesterday, Jim.
        <br>
        JUDGE
        And how was it possible for Mr.
        Tenenbaum to withdraw these funds
        without your written authorization?
